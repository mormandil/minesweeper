# minesweeper
An academic project.

In this project I built a minesweeper game using C language.

The player mission is to revel all open cells on board by avoiding mines.

The player choses the size of the board according to menu options, or customize its own size.

Each turn, the player choses a cell to open.

Each cell contain a bomb, a number or its an empty cell.

If the player steps on a bomb - THE GAME IS OVER.

A number cell indicates the amount of mines around that cell.

BONUS TIPS :
* You can put a flag on a cell suspicious to be a bomb.
* The input -1 X (X being a positive number) will open the first X cells.
