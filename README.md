# minesweeper
 An academic project.</br>
 In this project I built a minesweeper game using C language.</br>
 The player mission is to revel all open cells on board by avoiding mines.</br>
 The player choses the size of the board according to menu options, or customize its own size.</br>
 Each turn, the player choses a cell to open.</br>
 Each cell contain a bomb, a number or its an empty cell.</br>
 If the player steps on a bomb - THE GAME IS OVER.</br>
 A number cell indicates the amount of mines around that cell.

:bulb: BONUS TIPS :
* You can put a flag on a cell suspicious to be a bomb.
* The input **-1 X** (X being a positive number) will open the first X cells.
